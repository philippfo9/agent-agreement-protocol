# AAP Explainer Video — Storyboard & Prompts

## Concept: "Boundaries" (60-90 seconds)
Dark, cinematic, minimal. Think: Apple keynote meets crypto aesthetic.

## Scene 1: The Problem (0-15s)

**Visual:** Abstract AI agents (glowing orbs/geometric entities) moving chaotically in a dark void, exchanging data streams, making deals — but nothing is recorded, nothing is verified.

**Midjourney Prompt:**
`abstract AI agents as geometric luminous entities floating in dark void, exchanging glowing data streams between each other, chaotic energy, no structure, cinematic dark atmosphere, volumetric lighting, 8k, --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 7`

**Kling 3 Prompt:**
`Camera slowly pulls back revealing multiple glowing geometric AI entities chaotically exchanging light beams in a dark void, particles scatter randomly, no order, cinematic atmosphere`

**Text overlay:** "AI agents are already making deals."
**Then:** "But who's watching?"

## Scene 2: The Identity (15-30s)

**Visual:** One agent stops. A hexagonal frame appears around it — its on-chain identity. Human hand reaches in from above, touching the frame, establishing authority. The agent's glow stabilizes.

**Midjourney Prompt:**
`single luminous geometric AI entity enclosed in hexagonal wireframe border, human hand reaching from above touching the frame, establishing connection, stable calm glow, dark background, cinematic, Solana purple accents, --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 7`

**Kling 3 Prompt:**
`A chaotic glowing geometric entity gradually stabilizes as a hexagonal wireframe frame forms around it, a human hand descends from above and touches the frame, the entity's glow becomes calm and structured, purple accent lighting`

**Text overlay:** "Register identity. Set boundaries. Delegate authority."

---

## Scene 3: The Agreement (30-50s)

**Visual:** Two framed agents face each other. A document/contract materializes between them — glowing terms, escrow vault forming below. They each extend a tendril/beam to the contract, signing it. The contract seals with a Solana-purple lock.

**Midjourney Prompt:**
`two geometric AI entities with hexagonal frames facing each other, glowing contract document floating between them, each extending light beam to sign it, escrow vault crystallizing below, Solana purple lock seal, dark cinematic background, --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 7`

**Kling 3 Prompt:**
`Two structured geometric AI entities with hexagonal wireframes face each other, a glowing document materializes between them, they each extend beams of light to touch the document simultaneously, a purple crystalline lock forms sealing the agreement, camera slowly orbits`

**Text overlay sequence:**
- "Propose terms"
- "Lock escrow"
- "Sign on-chain"
- "Fulfill & close"

---

## Scene 4: The Trust Surface (50-65s)

**Visual:** Camera pulls back dramatically. Hundreds of agents, all framed, all connected by agreement lines. The network is structured, verifiable. A human observer can see any agreement by touching it — it expands to show terms, parties, status.

**Midjourney Prompt:**
`vast network of geometric AI entities connected by glowing agreement lines, structured graph visualization, dark background, one agreement highlighted and expanded showing document details, human silhouette observing from below, cinematic scale, volumetric purple light, --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 7`

**Kling 3 Prompt:**
`Camera dramatically pulls back revealing hundreds of structured geometric entities connected by thin light lines forming a vast network, camera zooms into one connection which expands into a glowing document showing structured terms, then zooms back out to show the full network, epic scale, purple accents`

**Text overlay:** "Every agreement. Verified. On-chain."

---

## Scene 5: The Close (65-80s)

**Visual:** The AAP logo forms from the network lines. Clean typography appears.

**Text overlay:**
"Agent Agreement Protocol"
"The legal layer for the agent economy"
"Built on Solana"

## Music
Dark ambient / electronic. Think: Odesza meets Hans Zimmer.
Suggestions:
- Artlist: search "dark ambient technology cinematic"
- Epidemic Sound: "sci-fi atmosphere minimal"

## Color Palette
- Background: #0a0a0a (matches our frontend)
- Agent glow: white/silver
- Agreement highlights: Solana purple (#9945FF)
- Escrow/lock: gold accent
- Text: white, clean sans-serif (Inter or similar)

## Tools Needed
1. **Midjourney** — Generate key frames
2. **Kling 3** — Animate scenes from key frames (img2video)
3. **After Effects / CapCut** — Add text overlays, transitions, music
4. **Optional: Runway Gen-3** — Alternative to Kling for video generation
